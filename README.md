# What

This is the collection of lua scripts that I use in my [EdgeTX](https://github.com/EdgeTX/edgetx) transmitters: MT12 for surface vehicles and Zorro for RC helis, airplanes, gliders, drones, etc.

# Directory

## Telemetry

### car.lua

This is a telemetry screen that displays important setups for RC cars (for my mini-z's and 1/10 touring car and buggy). It's probably not for crawlers.

## Mixes

### drgbrk.lua

TX initiated drag braking simulation

### abs.lua

Anti-lock Braking System (ABD) simulation

### tractl.lua

Traction control simulation
